# brew_formula
A collection of brew formulas I try to develop and maintain.


## cxmon
A formula for [cxmon](http://cxmon.cebix.net/), a an interactive
command-driven file manipulation tool that is inspired by the "Amiga
Monitor" by Timo Rossi. It has commands and features similar to a
machine code monitor/debugger, but it lacks any functions for
running/tracing code. There are, however, built-in PowerPC, 680x0, 80x86
(including x86-64), 6502 and Z80 disassemblers, and special support for
disassembling MacOS code.
